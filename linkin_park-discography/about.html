        <h1>About Us</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.

            Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer", "Crawling" and "In the End" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation's Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.[4]
            
            The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <h1>How Linkin Park Was Founded</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="about">
        <h2>1996–2000: Early years</h2>
        <p>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.[6][7] The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.[6][7] After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled Xero, released in November 1997.[6][8] However, tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal.[6] The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.[6][8] Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.[9][10]

            After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.[11][12] Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style.[6] The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.[6][13] In 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online "street team".[14]
            
            The band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels.[11] After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999.[15][16] However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid.[17][18] The band considered the names "Plear" and "Platinum Lotus Foundation" before deciding on "Linkin Park",[19] a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park,[6] now called Christine Emerson Reed Park.[20] They initially wanted to use the name "Lincoln Park", however they changed it to "Linkin" to acquire the internet domain "linkinpark.com".[18][21]
            
            Bennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial recordings.[22][23] The label's A&R was not pleased with the band's hip-hop and rock-style approach.[22][23] An A&R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record.[22][23] Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for the album.[22][23] Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, that same year</p>
