                <strong>Chester Charles Bennington</strong> (March 20, 1976 –
                July 20, 2017) was an American singer and songwriter who was
                best known as the lead vocalist of rock band Linkin Park. He was
                also the lead vocalist of the bands Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise,
                and Stone Temple Pilots. Bennington first gained prominence as a
                vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album,
                Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success.
                The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry
                Association of America in 2005, making it the best-selling debut
                album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to
                achieve that many sales. Linkin Park's following studio albums,
                from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), continued the
                band's success.
